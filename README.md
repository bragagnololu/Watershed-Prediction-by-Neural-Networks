# Watershed-Prediction-by-Neural-Networks

This repository is based on a project that modelg the rainflow of a watershed. For that, we proposed
the application of 4 Neural Networks to predict the final outflow based on temporal rain (rainfall) and on the
resulting outflow of the Watersheds analized.

## Watershed
As the aim of this repository, we studied a Watershed located in the south of Brazil, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
That covered several municipalities, such as: Get√∫lio Vargas, Erechim, Gaurama and Tapejara.

## Inputs
As inputs, we used the data from 3 Pluviometric Stations and 1 Fluviometric Station, in the total of 4 inputs.

## Outputs
As outputs, we predicted the final Outflow of the Watershed, based on the inputs.

## Fluxogram 
The workflow of this repository is shown in the following Fluxogram.
